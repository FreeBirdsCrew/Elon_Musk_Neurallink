We Learn and Grow Together.

## Elon Musk CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, Created Neuralink, a Neurological Company that is Developing ultra-high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers.
### Neuralink has three stated Goals: 
1. Treating brain disorders and helping people who had accidents.
2. Creating a brain-machine interface.
3. Building toward a potential symbiosis with artificial intelligence. 
The first of those Goals is the most Realistic in the Short-Term.
Musk's Neurallink is hoping to help solve major neurological issues. 

In Long-Term, Elon Musk said Neuralink will help to achieve a sort of symbiosis with Artificial Intelligence.

I also Explain how, Neuralink works with, How it Installed and Achieve the Success.
Shortly Explain, Electrodes read and write brain data. Neuralink is designing its electrodes not just to "read" from neurons what's going on in the brain, but also to "write" signals into the brain. "You can use this technology in the brain to restore a sense of touch or vision", Just like Matrix Movie Series.
